# Mind

## Overview

I have an idea for a new project and wanted a place to store all the things that have served as inspiration.

Mind enables storing image and video references used as inspiration for the new project.

## Technology Stack

## Setup

**All environments**

(Optional) Update permissions to all shell scripts in the `scripts` directory
```shell
chmod +rwx scripts/*
```

**Local dev**

1. Install dependencies with `./scripts/setup-local.sh`
2. Start containers with `docker-compose up`

**"Production Python Flask API"**

* Build images and run containers for the UI and Python Flask API with `./scripts/api-python/start-prod.sh`
* Alternatively, use `docker-compose` with `./scripts/api-python/start-prod-docker-compose.sh`

**"Production JSON Server"**

* Build images and run containers for the UI and JSON Server API with `./scripts/api-json-server/start-prod.sh`
* Alternatively, use `docker-compose` with `./scripts/api-json-server/start-prod-docker-compose-api-json-server.sh`

**Other**

If interested, everything can be run locally using `npm run dev` scripts.
```shell
npm run dev --prefix ./mind-api-json-server
npm run dev --prefix ./mind
```

## Mind Component Library

Run `npm run storybook --prefix ./mind` to start storybook for isolated component development or viewing a component gallery.

## Available NPM Scripts

Looking for what each npm script does? Try `npm run ntl` to select a script to run from a list of commands and their descriptions.
